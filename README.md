## Dataset

The dataset used to train the model comprises 24 classes of common grocery items found in the Philippines. These images were manually collected and annotated by the AI 231 class of UP Diliman (AY 2024‚Äì2025). To ensure the model's robustness, the dataset includes images captured under various environmental conditions, such as nighttime, daytime, and obstructed views.

## Model  

The application utilizes **YOLO11** by Ultralytics, the latest iteration in the YOLO series of real-time object detectors. YOLOv11 redefines object detection with cutting-edge accuracy, speed, and efficiency.  

### Model Variations  
YOLOv11 offers multiple variations to suit a wide range of tasks:  
- **Nano (n)**: Optimized for lightweight deployment.  
- **Small (s)**: Balances speed and accuracy for real-time use.  
- **Medium (m)**: Enhanced performance for more complex scenarios.  
- **Large (l)**: High-accuracy models for demanding tasks.  
- **Xtra-large (x)**: Maximum accuracy for advanced applications.  

Supported tasks include:  
- Object detection  
- Segmentation  
- Classification  
- Pose estimation  
- Oriented object detection  

For more details on model parameters and performance benchmarks (e.g., on the COCO dataset), visit the [Ultralytics YOLO11 Model Card](https://docs.ultralytics.com/models/yolo11).  

### Model Training
Models are trained on NVIDIA A100-SXM4-40GB GPU. Training time ranges from ~1 to 10 hours depending on the model variation and configuration.
