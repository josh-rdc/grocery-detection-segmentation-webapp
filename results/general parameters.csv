Parameter,Value,Definition
epochs,100,"Total number of training epochs, each represents a full pass over the entire dataset.
Affects training duration and model performance"
time,none,"Max training time in hours. 
Automatically stop after the specified duration"
patience,10,"Number of epochs to wait without improvement in validation metrics before early stopping the training. 
Helps prevent overfitting by stopping training when performance plateaus."
batch size,-1,Number of training examples utilized in one iteration of model training.
imgsz,640**,"Target image size for training. 
Affects model accuracy and computational complexity."
optimizer,auto,Choice of optimizer for training.
augmentation strategy*,random,"Introducing variability into the training data.
Helps the model generalize better to unseen data"
